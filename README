wsgi demo

this is a simple wsgi server
to demonstrate how to do things like read get or post data.
it uses no framework. just standard python modules.

motivation: i wanted to learn wsgi to write mock servers
to test web scrapers or automation scripts.
the mock servers do not need to be performant or secure.
they just need to be similar enough to the real servers.

demonstrating how to:
read GET data
read POST data
read cookies
write cookies
handle different pages
handle error pages (404)
send plain text response

still missing:
uploading file
downloading file
